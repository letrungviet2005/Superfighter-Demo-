# Superfighter-Demo-
Hi, I am Viet. After finishing semester 1 with the Java project (I was quite happy because as expected it got a good score), I had a lot of free time, usually I would go play badminton and learn another programming language or go to work. And that's when my memories came back, a really cool game I used to play with my younger brother called Superfighter on the Y8 website but unfortunately it didn't have an online mode and I thought no one was developing this game anymore. so I decided to create this game and add many great features to it. Here will be stored images, videos and some game code during the project development process.
